# SNN-Experiments
Here I'm sharing some of the **initial or unpublished** experiments I did with spiking neural networks (SNN). As I don't have time to expand them I hope they are going to be useful to someone else. Probably there are some (or lots of?) bugs, so feel free to correct them :)   

Biased Unsupervised Learning Method: a novel(???) way to use STDP
